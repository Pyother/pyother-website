# My official website

This project contains public part of my website, created in Express.js and React. Project involves multiple services:
* MongoDB database connection and services.
* Node.js crone events.
* Personal webscrapper - loading data from Github API.
* Universal, flexible website design.

I've decided to build my website design from scratch using Material UI instead of WordPress, and it gave me a lot of joy. I would like to invite you to visit my page and check out the results!
